# Overview

Here are all the notes on how I went about developing this obsidian plugin. 

Using rich text format's well, formatting is straightforward most of the time, however actually converting the formatting from markdown as it's rendered in obsidian to rtf was not as straightforward as initially thought.

Because of this, I will be going over each challenge, each "gotcha" and each decision i made in detail in the way I know best, which is step by step in chronological order.  

So if you follow along from top to bottom, by the end you will at least know in depth how rich text formatting really works, as well as all of my developing decisions.
